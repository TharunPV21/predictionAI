# predictionAI
Overview

This procedure outlines steps to predict the likelihood of heart disease using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.
Requirements

    Python (version X.X)
    Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow (optional for deep learning), etc.
    Dataset: Provide details or a link to the dataset used for training and testing.

Setup

    Install Dependencies:

    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

    Download Dataset:
        Provide instructions on how to obtain the dataset if not included.

    Project Structure:
        Describe the directory structure and files included (e.g., Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks).

Usage

    Data Preparation:
        Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize data, etc.).
        Describe feature selection and engineering if applicable.

    Model Training:
        Choose a suitable AIML algorithm (e.g., decision tree, random forest, neural network).
        Implement and train the model on the prepared dataset.
        Provide example code for training.

    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
        Discuss cross-validation techniques used (if any).

    Prediction:
        Illustrate how to make predictions on new data using the trained AIML model.
        Provide sample code for making predictions.

Results

    Summarize the performance of the AIML model(s) used.
    Discuss any insights gained from the prediction process.

Future Improvements

    Recommend potential enhancements to the model (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods).
    Consider incorporating more data sources or advanced AIML techniques.
